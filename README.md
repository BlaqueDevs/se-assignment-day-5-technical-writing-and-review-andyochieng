## 1. How can understanding your audience’s expertise level (tech experts vs. regular folks) shape the way you present technical information?
  1. Language & Terminology
Tech Experts: Use precise technical terms, minimal explanations.
Regular Folks: Simplify jargon, define terms, use analogies.
2. Depth of Explanation
Tech Experts: Focus on details, specifications, and advanced concepts.
Regular Folks: Emphasize basics, step-by-step guidance, and summaries.
3. Structure & Format
Tech Experts: Use structured docs, code snippets, flowcharts.
Regular Folks: Use visuals, FAQs, and easy-to-follow formats.
4. Purpose & Use Case
Tech Experts: Prioritize efficiency, troubleshooting, optimization.
Regular Folks: Focus on practical applications and usability.
Example (Cloud Storage)
Tech Experts: "Uses distributed object storage with erasure coding for data durability."
Regular Folks: "Saves files online for easy access and backup."
## 2. What are some strategies to tailor your content to different audience types?
  1. Identify Your Audience
